## Results {#results}

The overall ability of MAG methods to recapitulate the original chromosomal source genome results varied widely.
We consider the identity of a given MAG bin to be that of the genome that composes the largest proportion of sequence within that bin.
In other words if a bin is identifiably 70% species A and 30% species B we consider that to be a bin of species A.
Ideally, we wish to generate a single bin for each source genome comprised of the entire genome and no contigs from other genomes.
Some genomes are cleanly and accurately binned regardless of the assembler and binning method used (See Fig. (@fig:supspeciescov)).
Specifically, greater than 90% of _Streptomyces parvulus_ (minimum 91.8%) and _Clostridium baratii_ (minimum 96.4%) chromosomes are represented in individual bins across all methods.
However, no other genomes were consistently recovered by all methods for more than a 3rd of the chromosomes.
The 3 _Streptococcus_ genomes were particularly problematic, likely due to their similarity, with the best recovery for each ranging from 1.7% to 47.49%.

In terms of assembler, megahit resulted in the highest median chromosomal coverage across all binners (81.9%) with metaSPAdes performing worst (76.8%) (see Fig. (@fig:1topcoverage)).
In terms of binning tool, CONCOCT performed very poorly with a median 26% coverage for top hit per bin, followed by maxbin2 (83.1%), and metabat2 (88.5%).
It is perhaps unsuprising that the best performing binner in terms of bin top hit coverage was the metabinner DAS-TOOL that combines predictions from the other 3 binners (94.3% median top hit chromosome coverage per bin, (@fig:1topcoverage)).

Bin purity, i.e. the number of genomes present in a bin at >5% coverage, was largely equivalent across assemblers (see Fig. (@fig:1purity)), with a very marginally higher purity for IDBA.
In terms of binning tool, however, maxbin2 proved an outlier with nearly twice as many bins containing multiple species as the next binner.
The remaining binning tools were largely equivalent, producing chimeric bins at approximately the same rates.

Regardless of method, a very small proportion of plasmids were correctly binned in the bin that mostly contained chromosomal contigs from the same source genome.
Specifically, between 1.5% (IDBA-UD assembly with DAS Tool bins) and 29.2% (metaSPAdes with CONCOCT bins) were correctly binned at over 50% coverage.
In terms of metagenome assembly MetaSPAdes was far and away the most successful assembler at assembling plasmids with 66.2% of plasmids identifiable at greater than 50% coverage.
IDBA-UD performed worst with 17.1% of plasmids recovered, and megahit recovered 36.9%.
If the plasmid was successfully assembled it was placed in a bin by maxbin2 and CONCOCT, although a much smaller fraction correctly binned (typically less than 1/3rd).
Interestingly, metabat2 and DAS tool binners were a lot more conservative in assigning plasmid contigs to bins, however, of those assigned to bins nearly all were correctly binned (see Fig. (@fig:2plasmids)).

GIs displayed a similar pattern of assembly and correct binning performance as plasmids (see Fig. (@fig:3gis)).
These sequences were assembled uniformly badly (37.8-44.1%) with metaSPAdes outperforming the other two assembly approaches.
For CONCOCT and maxbin2 binning tools all GIs that were assembled were assigned to a bin although the proportion of binned GIs that were correctly binned was lower than for DAS Tool and metabat2.
DAS Tool, metabat2 and CONCOCT didn't display the same precipitious drop-off between those assembled and those correctly binned as was observed for plasmids.
In terms of overall correct binning with the chromosomes from the same genome the metaSPAdes assembly with CONCOCT (44.1%) and maxbin2 (43.3%) binners performed best.

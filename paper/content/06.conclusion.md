## Conclusions {#conclusions}

- Plasmids and GIs are difficult to recover in metagenome assemblies.
- Even if they are recovered they are disproportionately binned incorrectly
- Clinically important AMR genes and virulence factors are found in these mobile genetic elements.
- This has severe implications for the study of antimicrobial resistance and AMR using MAGs.

## Introduction {#intro}

- What are metagenomic methods?
    - Why are they great?
        profiling, papers from public health focus
    - What is the problem?
        fragmentary contigs
- Metagenome assembled genomes
    - What are they?
    - How do they work?
    - Metabat, concoct [justify this selection with CAMI citation?]
    - How have they been sucessful [Laura Hug paper, UBA paper]
- What are plasmids and genomic islands?
    - How are we defining GI [IslandPath paper?]
    - What do they contain? [Including justin's analysis of prevalence of AMR genes]
    - We care because they are mobile

- Metagenome simulation
    - who else has used simulated data to assess FIONA paper and CAMI
    - lognormal distribution CAMI citation
    - plasmid copy number citations? [where did the low. medium and high come from]

## Discussion {#discussion}

- CONCOCT seems to display a trend of generating lots of small partial bins

- Correct binning didn't assess uniqueness, i.e. CONCOCT may have performed well relatively in some of the GI/Plasmid binning analysis by non-redundantly binning

- The problems of plasmid assembly is well known and Plasmid assembly might perform better using a specific plasmid assembler [@doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000128].

- Justin GI/Plasmid AMR context numbers?

- The drop-off in correct binning suggests binning plasmids is harder than GIs.

- This might be to do with plasmids having overall more divergent composition features relative to chromosomes.

- Interestingly GIs were apparently harder to assemble than plasmids
